GraphQL Relay Server
-----
> A GraphQL server with minimal Relay support for use in [React Native Relay](https://github.com/danielfeelfine/react-native-relay)

### Start
After clone this repo, move to project path and install all dependencies:
```
$ yarn
```

When you need the _schema_ introspection for [Babel Relay Plugin](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/guides-babel-plugin.html):
```
$ yarn update-schema
```
And the _schema_ files will be generated in the `data` path.

### Running
```
$ yarn start
```
*You can also use* `npm`, but `yarn` is better and more faster.
